# Programiranje2



This is a repository of solutions to my assigments at class "Programiranje 1" at my university.
Code is automatically tested via Travis with every push/pull.


Every assigment directory has raw code, test file and makefile in it.
Test is executed from ./scripts.
Test script iterate through the assisgments, running makefile in each which tests the code with given inputs and outputs.



You can test the code yourself using command ./scripts/tests.sh
